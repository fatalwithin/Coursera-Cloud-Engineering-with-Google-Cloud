## Module Overview

In this module we cover Cloud Identity and Access Management or Cloud IAM. 
Cloud IAM is a sophisticated system built on top of email-like address names, job type roles in granular permissions. If you're familiar with IAM from other implementations look for the differences that Google has implemented to make IAM easier to administer and more secure. 
I will start by introducing Cloud IAM from a high-level perspective. We will then dive into each of the components within Cloud IAM which are organizations, roles, members and service accounts. I will also introduce some best practices to help you apply these concepts in your day-to-day work. 
Finally, you will gain firsthand experience with Cloud IAM through a Lab. Let's get started with an overview of Cloud Identity and Access Management.

## Cloud IAM

So what is identity access management? 
It is a way of identifying who can do what, on which resource. The who can be a person, group, or application. The what refers to specific privileges or actions, and the resource could be any GCP service. For example I could give you the privilege or role of compute viewer. This provides you with read-only access to get enlist Compute Engine resources without being able to read the data stored on them. 
Cloud IAM is composed of different objects as shown on this slide. We are going to cover each of these in this module. To get a better understanding of where these fit in, let's look at the Cloud IAM resource hierarchy. 
Google Cloud Platform resources are organized hierarchically as shown in this tree structure. 
The organization node is the root node in this hierarchy. 
Folders are the children of the organization. 
Projects are the children of the folders, and the individual resources are the children of projects. Each resource has exactly one parent. 
Cloud IAM allows you to set policies at all of these levels. Where a policy contains a set of roles, and role members. Let me go through each of the levels from top to bottom, because resources inherit policies from their parent. 
The organization resource represents your company. Cloud IAM roles granted at this level are inherited by all resources under the organization. The folder resource could represent your department. Cloud IAM roles granted at this level are inherited by all resources that the folder contains. Projects represent a trust boundary within your company. Services within the same project have a default level of trust. 
The Cloud IAM policy hierarchy always follows the same path as the GCP resource hierarchy, which means that if you change the resource hierarchy the policy hierarchy also changes. For example, moving a project into a different organization will update the projects Cloud IAM policy to inherit from the new organizations Cloud IAM policy. 
Also, child policies cannot restrict access granted at the parent level. For example, if I grant you that editor role for department X, and I grant you the viewer role at the Bookshelf project level, you still have the editor role for that project. Therefore, it is a best practice to follow the principle of least privilege. The principle applies to identities, roles, and resources. Always select the smallest scope that's necessary for the task in order to reduce your exposure to risk.

### Organization

Let's learn more about the organization node. 
As I mentioned earlier, the organization resource is the root node in the GCP resource hierarchy. This node has many roles, like the organization admin. 
The organization admin provides a user like Bob, with access to administer all resources belonging to his organization, which is useful for auditing. 
There is also a project creator role, which allows a user like Alice, to create projects within her organization. I am showing the project creator role here because it can also be applied at the organization level, which would then be inherited by all the projects within the organization. The organization resource is closely associated with a G Suite or Cloud Identity Account. When a user with a G Suite or Cloud Identity Account creates a GCP project an organization resource is automatically provisioned for them. Then Google Cloud communicates its availability to the G Suite or Cloud Identity super admins. These super admin accounts, should be used very carefully because they have a lot of control over your organization and all the resources underneath it. 
The G Suite or Cloud Identity super administrators and the GCP organization admin are key roles during the setup process and for lifecycle control, for the organization resource. The two roles are generally assigned to different users or groups, although this depends on the organization structure and needs. In the context of GCP organization setup, the G Suite or Cloud Identity super administrator responsibilities are: assign the organization admin role to some users, be a point of contact in case of recovery issues, control the lifecycle of the G Suite or Cloud Identity account and organization resource. 
The responsibilities of the organization admin role are: define IAM policies, determine the structure of the resource hierarchy, delegate responsibility over critical components such as networking, billing, and resource hierarchy, through IAM roles. Following the principle of least privilege, this role does not include the permission to perform other actions, such as creating folders. To get these permissions, an organization admin must assign additional roles to their account. For more information about creating and managing organizations, see the how-to guide, in the link section of this video. 
Let's talk more about folders, because they can be viewed as sub organizations within the organization. Folders provide an additional grouping mechanism and isolation boundary between projects. Folders can be used to model different legal entities, departments, and teams within a company. For example, a first-level of folders can be used to represent the main departments in your organization, like departments x and y. Because folders, can contain projects in other folders, each folder could then include other subfolders to represent different teams, like teams A and B. Each team folder could contain additional subfolders, to represent different applications, like products 1 and 2. 
Folders allow delegation of administration rights, for example, each head of a department, can be granted full ownership of all GCP resources that belong to their department. Similarly, access to resources can be limited by folder, so users in one department can only access and create GCP resources, within that folder. Let's look at some other resource manager roles, while remembering that policies are inherited from top to bottom. 
The organization node also has a viewer role. They grants view access to all resources within an organization. 
The folder node has multiple roles that mimic the organizational roles, but are applied to resources within a folder. 
There is an admin role that provides full control over folders. A creator role, to browse the hierarchy and create folders, and a viewer role, to view folders and projects below a resource. 
Similarly for projects, there is a creator role that allows a user to create new projects, making that user automatically the owner. There is also a project deleter role that grants deletion privileges for projects.
